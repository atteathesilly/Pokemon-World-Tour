Over and out."1Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?"LWell then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at."’I just like... Iâ€™m a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves."I don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a PokÃ©mon trainer."AOr I was. And Iâ€™m... rather good at it. And not much else."bA friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results."aI mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on."(Heyo, \PN. Hear youâ€™ve been busy."YYouâ€™re just racking up badges like theyâ€™re nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud."5Itâ€™s not a compliment. Just stating the facts."~And the fact is that youâ€™re not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain."*Iâ€™ve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you."“Iâ€™m literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael."Word gets around."kI also know that youâ€™re gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help."Yikes."Yeah, Mavis isâ€¦ Mavis."CYou know, youâ€¦ ah, nevermind. Eye on the prize and all that."JSpeaking of which, you need to get <imp>across the river</imp>, yeah?"0We might be able to reach an arrangement...")But. But... you know how this works."TQuid pro quo, yeah? I know youâ€™ve scratched a few avatars off of my hit list."TGonna be clear as crystal here: youâ€™re doing better than most of the rangers."\Such as the ones that recently just got mauled by a particularly ornery Steelix avatar."SYou know me so well. Put the thing in the ground â€“ well, more in the ground."cItâ€™s ripping through the mine yard in <imp>Grouz</imp> at the moment, which isâ€¦ a problem."YIf it goes down particular routes we could be facing a VERY uncomfortable situation."IThe rangers? Dealing with rampaging Tauros and crossroads hauntings."gAvatars are out of their paygrade. Not that we donâ€™t send them in anyways and hope for the best."hSpeaking of which: <imp>Grouz</imp>. Squad went out and didnâ€™t leave a scratch on the damn thing."/You can split it right open, though, yeah?"YYou donâ€™t know what busy looks like, kid. You think Iâ€™m not trying to work here?"fI know you cut a deal with Helena. Same here: you accelerate my timetable, I do the same for you."USo make your way down to <imp>Grouz</imp> and turn that Steelix to slag. Please?"rIâ€™ll check back in on you when I hear that behemothâ€™s gone. Promise Iâ€™ll make it worth your while, too."Capisce? Good. Bye."â€¦She hung up."ABefore you can put your phone away, it starts ringing again."%It seems like an important call."*\PN, I need your help. Itâ€™s urgent."4You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?"JThereâ€™s an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now."ZIâ€™ll explain when you get here â€“ this isnâ€™t the most secure way to communicate."DItâ€™s bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber."[Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I canâ€™t overstate how much I need your help ASAP."JListen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would."uBut things change, and now all I have is you. You are NOT going to like the consequences if you donâ€™t help me."Please."=Bring the best team youâ€™ve got. Itâ€™s gonna get ugly."?Hey, just checking in. Whatâ€™s going on? Making progress?"SOh, wow. Really trying your liâ€™l heart out, arenâ€™t you? More than one gym!",Ah, donâ€™t get all broken up about it."[You could be in the big city with six badges under your belt and it wouldnâ€™t matter."Why, I never."6Havenâ€™t you heard bloodâ€™s thicker than water?""Practically a type advantage.")Well, whatever -- keep your secrets."8As for me, Iâ€™m taking a break before facing Noel."nYou donâ€™t know him -- and, letâ€™s be honest, you probably never will -- but heâ€™s kind of a big deal."bSo while youâ€™re scuttling to and fro like a Falinks without an officer, Iâ€™ll be relaxing."Wish you were here!"He hung upâ€¦"(Wow, that wasâ€¦ a complete breeze."A joke, honestly."&Thatâ€™s my sixth badge now. You?"Wow. I remember that."1Wait, how did you even schedule a challenge?"4I made an appointment before I got on the ship."2You... you're serious about this, aren't you?"That canâ€™t be right."Youâ€™re better than that."UNot by much, but if youâ€™re lying, thenâ€¦ youâ€™re taking this seriously. Huh."Hah! That never gets old."LYou remind me ofâ€¦ I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.",But you are really angry, arenâ€™t you?"\Well, youâ€™ve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder."1Youâ€™ve still got a lot of ground to cover."!See you at the championship!"4Iâ€™ll make sure to look in the stands for you."He hung upâ€¦ again."/Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?"0Good. Youâ€™ve got eight badges now, right?"xThatâ€™s... itâ€™s something. Youâ€™ll excuse me if Iâ€™m not too preoccupied with the whole gym challenge shebang."That makes one of us."KBetween the avatars and... recent developments... Iâ€™ve been swamped."XYeah, frickinâ€™ tell me about it. I know exactly what youâ€™re talking about, too."ZListen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but weâ€™re in the endgame now."_Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyoneâ€™s happy, right? Smiles all round."(So, yeah, just a liâ€™l bit longer."}Take down those avatars if you can spare the time, come back to Prizca for the Championship, and... weâ€™ll see about Yezera."&Thanks, \PN. I know itâ€™s a lot."Thanks."MWhoever the hell it is helping Yezera, theyâ€™ve been making the rounds."iGood news is that you seem to be their priority. Havenâ€™t been, yâ€™know, rampaging. Which is good."Iâ€™ve had zero luck trying to track them down. Iâ€™d hire Alessa again if sheâ€™d return my calls â€“ but, hey, thatâ€™s why I have you, right?"Yes and no. Youâ€™re gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ainâ€™t just busywork this time."jNot that it ever is â€“ thanks, by the way â€“ but this one should be especially interesting for you."jThatâ€™s what I like to hear. This ainâ€™t gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities."gMostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?"4Youâ€™re gonna want to hear this one. Trust me."wI mean, youâ€™ve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... itâ€™s pretty dire, importance- wise."gIâ€™ve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. Sheâ€™s back in her hometown â€“ <imp>Whitebloom</imp>."eYezeraâ€™s got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so sheâ€™s your first priority."a\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. Sheâ€™s... dealt with a lot." But do what you have to do."\Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion."$Happy endings all-round, right?"Right. Bye."GHey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain."aSucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!"BHeard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>."YThe whole idea is that you can fight through a gauntlet of AI trainers. Neat, right?"zThey're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine."XI'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie."kOh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean."IIf I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair."nAnyways, I'll be hanging around the Battle Monument for the foreseeable future, so meet me here, ya hear?"JI've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against you."..."t...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now."VHope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera. Bye bye!"â€¦They hung up.",They must really want to talk with you."dA couple seconds later, you receive a text message with the coordinates to the Battle Monument."Hello to you, young one."It is I, Dr. Hekata."TDo not worry about how I learned of your cellphone number. I simply divined it."2I have a topic to discuss of some importance."PI beseech youâ€”<imp>visit my abode in Grouz</imp>. There we shall discuss."DApologies for the interruption to your adventure, young master."wHowever, given that you've sent a number of Pokemon to Storage, I thought it best that I inform you of my project."GTo make it short: Your family owns an unused Estate here in Makya."pSince you're taking on the Makyan Gym Challenge, I took the initiative to renovate the grounds for our use."dI've set up a system that sends the Pokemon you store in your PC to this <imp>PokÃ‰state</imp>."GI'll take care of them there while you are busy with your journey."pI love Pokemon variety, so I've prepared lots of <imp>EXP Candy</imp> to give you as your collection grows."COnce you've earned some, I'll send them to you through the PC."nI'll continue to wait for you on the boat. If you want to visit the PokÃ‰state, send me a ping at any PC."%I'll take you there immediately."?That is all. I will distract you no further, young master."A\i[TAROTAMULET]The Tarot Amulet spasms like something dying."uYou feel your pupils dilate and somewhere bleak and broken almost comes into view at the corners of your vision."SA womanâ€™s voice whispers from that place â€“ almost familiar, but not quite."8You shouldnâ€™t have reversed that amulet, dearest."<The woman who gave it to you was trying to protect you."QNow, though, charms for safe beginnings turn to invitations of dire endings."gMaybe thereâ€™s something to learn from interlacing your journey with the path of ordeals, though."zEnjoy this brief, bitter taste of the end, darling, and Iâ€™ll try and pull some strings should you prove victorious."3\i[TAROTAMULET]Once again the amulet twitches."UOnce again, you can almost make something out, just past your peripheral vision."Once again, she speaks."(Oh? Youâ€™re back, dearest. Lovely."UThese people are tied inextricably to this regionâ€™s secrets; its conspiracies."oLet me implant a bit of my demesne into theirs, and I might be able to tease them open like a faulty lock."@You want to know more, donâ€™t you? Want them to trust you?")Then prepare to enjoy another trial.",\i[TAROTAMULET]Itâ€™s the amulet again."^It isnâ€™t the thing itself thatâ€™s in pain. No, something else is â€“ something larger."'Something is wrong in this region.",Another challenge, another opportunity."yI never put much stock into mysticism until my hand was forced. Iâ€™m so glad to see my investment paying dividends."MThese people donâ€™t even know Iâ€™m threading their fate through yours!"cI paint an impressed expression on their malleable faces â€“ so long as you can walk the walk."/Go on, dearest. You know the rules by now."R\i[TAROTAMULET]The reversed amulet spasms and the other place impends on you."-That voiceâ€¦ itâ€™s painfully familiar."*Oh, you already know who I am, child."nIâ€™m the one thatâ€™s waiting for you at the end of the line. The end of your lineâ€¦ and of every line."&Makya is a place rich in history."VThatâ€™s why you endure these tastes of my demesne, isnâ€™t it? To learn history?"=Well, even history ends. Youâ€™ll understand eventually."6Go on. Show me what a conqueror you are, darling."Z\i[TAROTAMULET]At this point, you can almost hear fate whimpering through the amulet."3Her voice shushes it, but does not comfort it."€Where did Imogene get this thing? I doubt she realized the significance of the sliver of stone she implanted within this amulet."QIt was uplifted from a forbidden place where history is tortuous and frayed."„Its latent power, the witchâ€™s arcana, and, of course, myâ€¦ expertiseâ€¦ all aligned to make my little bits of influence possible."-I hope you feel lucky, darling: you are."Always."\i[TAROTAMULET]....."MThereâ€™s something calming about the hellscape you can almost perceive."*Itâ€™s a calm hell; quiet and somber." Her voice is much the same."If only I could twist these gym leadersâ€™ roles without having to suffuse their arenas with my demesne and all itsâ€¦ antipathy."*History ends quietly, but not kindly."OHere, our day-to-day lives are much like what you endure in these battles."Oh, donâ€™t pity me. My only point is that I would gladly spare you the intensity of fateâ€™s dying gasps if I could, trust me."Trust me, darling."v\i[TAROTAMULET]As the amulet twists and writhes, you can feel the tension of invisible threads being pulled taut."8They are wrapped around the amulet, and around you."sSomewhere behind you they frayed into thousands of strands, and ahead of you they extend to somewhere distant."There they all end.":You understand by now, donâ€™t you? Makya is history.">You, darling, are a history to me â€“ a singular history."3And I am a singular history projected forward."You have the benefit of what weâ€™ll call a privileged reference frame, and I thank you dearly for letting me glimpse through your eyes at it."0Not to mention making a fewâ€¦ alterations."+Donâ€™t think too hard on it, dearest.".\i[TAROTAMULET]The amulet has gone still."^Something is changing â€“ the threads are being woven back together, or severed, or both."4Someone is taking matters into their own hands."No, that isnâ€™t me."0We both know who it is, though, donâ€™t we?"dYou should probably stop her from doing that, or one of us could end up in the otherâ€™s place."IYou were not made for the terminus, and I was not made for a utopia."=And no human was made for the paradise sheâ€™s planning.",â€¦\PN, you know who I am, donâ€™t you?"]We wonâ€™t be speaking for a little while, but know that Iâ€™m watching over you, child."My child."â€¦Agonizingly familiar."[But, still, she is a stranger to you, this woman who almost has your motherâ€™s voice."	\PN."$Iâ€™m swallowing my pride here."EI need your help with something... more important than my pride."You like that, don't you?"5Helping people?

Over and out."1Uh -- yes? Did you want to ask me something?"LWell then don't -- can you not -- I'm not a big fan of being stared at."’I just like... Iâ€™m a wanderer. Or, rather, not a wanderer -- but I don't have a home -- or, well -- excuse me. I spend most of my time in caves."I don't know? I mean -- no, I know, but rather I'm not sure why -- I mean, what kind of question is that? I'm a PokÃ©mon trainer."AOr I was. And Iâ€™m... rather good at it. And not much else."bA friend's. Just a friend's. I'm good at -- they entrust me with the training. I get results."aI mean, that sounds -- that's not what I really meant. I'm -- I'm -- I was -- let's move on."(Heyo, \PN. Hear youâ€™ve been busy."YYouâ€™re just racking up badges like theyâ€™re nothing, huh? Mavis must be so proud."5Itâ€™s not a compliment. Just stating the facts."~And the fact is that youâ€™re not getting anywhere now unless you come meet me, for reasons that make me too angry to explain."*Iâ€™ve got a <imp>gift</imp> for you."“Iâ€™m literally friends with two - I mean ONE - of those gym leaders, and I was the commanding officer for half the people keeping track of Rafael."Word gets around."kI also know that youâ€™re gonna have some issues getting <imp>across that river</imp> without my help."Yikes."Yeah, Mavis isâ€¦ Mavis."CYou know, youâ€¦ ah, nevermind.

Itâ€™s urgent."4You know the <imp>catacombs</imp> under Prizca?"JThereâ€™s an entrance in the <imp>sewers</imp>. I need you here, now."ZIâ€™ll explain when you get here â€“ this isnâ€™t the most secure way to communicate."DItâ€™s bad, though. Real bad. I need a trainer of your caliber."[Thanks. I know this is sudden, but I canâ€™t overstate how much I need your help ASAP."JListen, kid, if I could call in a couple Chasm strike teams, I would."uBut things change, and now all I have is you.

Huh."Hah! That never gets old."LYou remind me ofâ€¦ I guess a Zangoose, right? So angry, but so normal.",But you are really angry, arenâ€™t you?"\Well, youâ€™ve certainly made good time, but this is where things start getting harder."1Youâ€™ve still got a lot of ground to cover."!See you at the championship!"4Iâ€™ll make sure to look in the stands for you."He hung upâ€¦ again."/Hey, \PN. Things going well on your front?"0Good. Youâ€™ve got eight badges now, right?"xThatâ€™s... itâ€™s something.

Iâ€™ve been swamped."XYeah, frickinâ€™ tell me about it. I know exactly what youâ€™re talking about, too."ZListen: I know the stress is probably getting to you, but weâ€™re in the endgame now."_Be a hero, become Champion, go home to Mavis. Everyoneâ€™s happy, right?

I know itâ€™s a lot."Thanks."MWhoever the hell it is helping Yezera, theyâ€™ve been making the rounds."iGood news is that you seem to be their priority. Havenâ€™t been, yâ€™know, rampaging.

Youâ€™re gonna have to cut through some of the best trainers in the region, but it ainâ€™t just busywork this time."jNot that it ever is â€“ thanks, by the way â€“ but this one should be especially interesting for you."jThatâ€™s what I like to hear. This ainâ€™t gonna be an easy operation, but I trust in your abilities."gMostly in committing violence. Lots of violence. Though, actually, maybe try talking this one out?"4Youâ€™re gonna want to hear this one. Trust me."wI mean, youâ€™ve got a minute before the Championship anyways. This op is... itâ€™s pretty dire, importance- wise."gIâ€™ve got a confirmed sighting on Yezera. Sheâ€™s back in her hometown â€“ <imp>Whitebloom</imp>."eYezeraâ€™s got a few titans on her and some kind of master plan, so sheâ€™s your first priority."a\PN... thanks in advance. Try and be understanding with Yezera. Sheâ€™s... dealt with a lot." But do what you have to do."\Do what you have to do, come back to Prizca for the tournament, and go home a Champion."$Happy endings all-round, right?"Right. Bye."GHey-o! Been a lil' bit but I managed to pry your number from Zain."aSucks that I couldn't face you in the Tournament, but I've got a surprise to make up for it!"BHeard about this place called the <imp>Battle Monument</imp>."YThe whole idea is that you can fight through a gauntlet of AI trainers. Neat, right?"zThey're weird about directly inviting people, but you're a champion so you should just waltz right in. It'll be fine."XI'll send the GPS coordinates to you so you can sail on over and give it a looksie."kOh yeah, guess I didn't say before, but the Battle Monument is a big tower in the middle of the ocean."IIf I didn't know better, I'd think it was some evil villainous lair."nAnyways, I'll be hanging around the Battle Monument for the foreseeable future, so meet me here, ya hear?"JI've got some new team configurations I really wanna try against you."..."t...Ok yeah someone here just asked to battle me, and I'm not gonna turn that down, so I gotta end the call now."VHope you're doing well, be safe, make good choices, have fun, et cetera.

My doppelganger and I are more alike than we are different."QHow, precisely, would a Ditto learn to imitate my manners with such care...?"JI suppose it bears little tangible relevance to my situation, though."=Oh, Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m such a glum philosopher archetype."™If I must play a stock role in your story, I would prefer to be an oracle distributing wisdom, or a magical creature bestowing some blessing or artifact."CI hope youâ€™re not expecting any wisdom or artifacts from me."[I fear Iâ€™m far too invested in my own quest for self- discovery to aid you in yours."‹...Oh, that isnâ€™t true. I canâ€™t maintain a charade of indifference half as well as my companion.

You are plainly at the center of a whorl of causality here â€“ it takes no arcana to determine that."pI cannot ascertain the future with any degree of certainty, but I can plainly see which way the river cuts."AI would like to liberate its path of hindrances if possible."xOh! Excuse me, I refer merely to my interest in seeing your rather unique path through fateâ€™s weave come to pass."]Well, that and a respectable appreciation for the quality of your character and company."‡It was not my intent to imply an interest in an... assignation, if that was what you were asking. Such passions are not my lot in life."_Consider it a professional curiosity, if that might ease your concerns... or insecurities."FYou are of note not merely for your personality and character â€“"ithough I confess some partiality to both â€“ but for the briar-knot of fate you are embedded within."TMany lives are wound around you.

But I must keep the faith."…After all, if I am merely some animal that has deluded itself into humanity... well, the ethical quandaries alone would drive me mad."nOh, plenty. Scraps of childhood, as I said.

I want to see how you bloom."CIf you've beat four gyms, I'll give you a reward to celebrate."'Are you doing your best out there?"I'm rooting for you."Hey-yo!"pHope you still remember me. I was the good-lookin' trainer camping out in front of the gym in Casaba Villa."tWell now I'm here, and the story's the same. Honing my skills with a team custom-built for the gym leader here."lThough I'm looking forward to it, it'll also be a little bitter-sweet having to take out a fellow enby."XAnyways, I'll be here for now, ready and willing to battle you as much as you want!"Wanna go?"Understood."+I'll be here until you wish to battle."Glorious combat!"jOuch. That one hurts. Gotta get used to the pain, though, or else I won't stand a chance against Eko!"0A good fight, really got the blood flowin'." Return later for a rematch."jI can tell from the scorch marks that you went up against Eko, and from the gym badge...that you won!"aThat means the time for procrastinating is over, and the time for courage is nigh. Allons-y!"Oh, hey. You a trainer?"qListen, I got some PokÃ©mon that need training andâ€¦ youâ€™re giving me the look like ya heard this before."LDid you run into a young woman, little younger than me, missin' an arm?"Togekiss with her?">Well, I do the same thing as her, only I get paid for it."ESo, uh, care to make this training session a little less boring?"GAh, no pressure. Just figured a duel might make it a bit more fun."!Ah, just a good olâ€™ fight."{These beasties ainâ€™t anything special â€“ students want their PokÃ©mon to stay in fighting condition, but exams are hell."EThatâ€™s where I come in. Wallet a little lighter, mind at ease."3Great. Letâ€™s keep these things fighting fit."%You down to help me train these?"3You ainâ€™t just any two-bit tourist, are you?"oTell me: you got a rival? Someone that you keep running into at the worst times? Pushes you to your limit?"IOh, Iâ€™ve heard that one before. Family drama. Tale as old as time."(Best of luck with that, I sâ€™pose."Great."/Ya donâ€™t have to tell me. Not important.";So long as youâ€™ve got someone â€“ you need somebody."'Really? Nobody good enough for ya?"dWell, sâ€™pose it donâ€™t matter too much. Youâ€™ve done plenty fine without one so far, right?"	Hah!"^Nah, kid. I already crossed that bridge, and itâ€™s the kinda road ya donâ€™t walk twice."'Bout wore me out, too."6Youâ€™re good, though, and Iâ€™m beinâ€™ genuine."*Ya beat my friend and now ya beat me."5Ainâ€™t half-bad. I ainâ€™t paid to gab, though."yGotta get movinâ€™ â€“ Trubbish needs training, and the <imp>sewers 'neath LuxTech</imp> are the place to be for it."+Here ya go, though, for your troubles."\See ya 'round. And, hey, you run into my friend again, beat the tar outta her, alright?"Novo Apartments"No."	Yes."No"Yes"Maybe later."Sure, let's go."Not right now."What exactly do you need?"Sure thing."My

He wouldn't have been able to guard this place for so long without a trick up his sleeve."1His team is built around the Dancer ability."EWhen you see him send out his Bellossom or his Alolan Marowak...")Well, all I'm saying is be prepared."Best of luck, friend."'You managed to win against Rafael?"(Great work, you got some real grit."mIf the avatar problem here ever gets sorted out, I'll try to go watch your next high profile match live."Well I'll be damned."EAfter all this time, I finally got to see Rafael leave his post."9He had the biggest damn smile I've ever seen on him."You did good."?You've probably saved me and Rafael a lot of cash as well."aWe're down here most of the time, so we've lost a lot of money getting food delivered to us."\Helena would probably kill us if she found out how much we've spent on delivery fees...00Iu; X[[

Recent excursions have promised field-shaking discoveries."The avatar crisis has only existed for less than half a year, but already fossil analysis has found striking resemblances to ancient Pokemon."lSkeletons found by researchers are significantly larger than the bone structure of modern counterparts."DNovo College has an accoladed history in the material sciences."fThe Rematerializer was voted by Trainers as one of the most useful inventions in the last decade."WWe also work closely with Pokemon Centers in order to improve medicinal practices."kMakya has a stunningly biodiverse ecosystem, which has raised the mystery of how it got to that point."zOne theory is that immigration to the region has brought stowaway Pokemon, or foreign Pokemon released into the wild."QAnother theory is the Makyan environmental policy is particularly effective."“For both theories, the counterargument is that fossil records show that Makya has had this biodiversity before human settlements were even founded."zIn collaboration with Eko, Novo Town's Gym Leader, Novo College is developing new pain-relief medication for Pokemon."rWhile status-relieving medicine serves a purpose, its main flaw is that it is reactive rather than proactive."€As a response to this issue, the College has been working to develop a new ointment, which can be applied to Pokemon once a day."RUnlike existing medicines, it serves to stop status pains before they happen."zPokemon in the midst of battle will still feel the effects, long-term pain will be numbed a few minutes after combat."Career battling Pokemon benefit most from this, as continued exposure to untreated status can result in chronic pains once the Pokemon retires from battling."ŠThe avatar crisis has disrupted much of Makya's already strained infrastructure, as travel between settlements has become quite dangerous."}To help combat this, Novo College has been offering free courses to Trainers and Rangers who wish to keep Makyan routes safe."]Multiple professors and students work to develop new strategies to defeat these avatars."nExperienced Trainers with a history of battling avatars are encouraged to volunteer in educational roles."|One of the College's latest projects involved tracking genetic signatures in the Golett, Baltoy, and Castform families."qWhile the exact methods of reproduction elude scientists, many suspect that selection forces remain at play."ƒHow this natural selection impacts man-made Pokemon could have remarkable insights on how other Pokemon change form over millennia."9Applications for the current school year are closed."1Acceptance letters will be sent out shortly."[LuxTech Scholars will be contacted by a representative on their first week of classes."HGreetings.

Iâ€™ve heard of this phenomenon."tI have my suspicions that the true nature of the avatars and Makyaâ€™s unique properties share a common origin."€The unique ecological pressures that create the Makyan forms must stem from the same source as the avatars. Iâ€™m certain of it."vThis region has several pockets of blatantly unnatural climatology â€“ its immense cave network chief among them."BThere is more to this region than I have discovered thus far."M...But, excuse me.

But I swear I didnâ€™t rob anyone that didnâ€™t totally deserve it." So shut up and help me, OK?";What Iâ€™m gonna need you to do is give me some cover."9Duel me? Like, so they just see a fight and move on?"PYâ€™know, like in a movie when they kiss so the bad guys get all flustered?"pI figured youâ€™d be more into, like, fighting me than kissing me.

Under her profound guidance, we have achieved our goals."rThe titans have served their purpose. I come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?"PThank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world."<My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple."„The world at present is mercurial and deceptive.

Iâ€™m going to find out soon enough."9Thereâ€™s only so many types of people in the world.":I just told you: because humiliating you will be fun."MUnless you mean extracting Regidrago, in which case, no, I wonâ€™t tell."bHumans have this infuriatingly self-destructive need to tell secrets.

It doesnâ€™t make any sense.">She should be the last person to pull this kind of stunt."XIt is. Itâ€™s your problem now, and I know you arenâ€™t gonna like that, but it is."5This is bigger than just one legendary PokÃ©mon."4Remember what I said about the big open secret?"oThe caves around Makya are tombs for the Regis. The weird ones I was talking about before. Ones like this."NWell, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back."yAnd then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that."{We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm. I was one of those original archaeologists."nâ€¦Some of us. Helena wanted to run her own region. Andris wanted a piece of the organized crime bigtime."QMe, I study the Regis. And some people wanted me to leave well enough alone."jI had a Team and Regidrago on my side, and they didnâ€™t, so I got to study what I damn well pleased."LSome of us. I didnâ€™t. I had five Regis â€“ what did I need money for?"8If I wanted lab equipment, I sent a list to Helena."GI lived in a research station and ate ramen. Best days of my life."oI just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.")You make it sound so pure and noble."bI was curious. Wanted answers. I got them â€“ who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?"YNot to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable."QIâ€™m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?"5As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis."\It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature."JThat led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas."RGigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too."|Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through."2And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact."iIt could doâ€¦ other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal PokÃ©mon with its power.";They were hostile, powerful â€“ had to be locked away."}And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew."pWe were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course â€“ just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigasâ€™s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I donâ€™t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics."MI know thingsâ€¦ havenâ€™t been great for her, but this? This is insane."[Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back â€“ they always have been."PBut succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. Butâ€¦ apparently Yezera can."*â€¦Probably. They might already have."nGigasâ€™s chamber is deep down, though, and if they havenâ€™t broken the seal yet, itâ€™d be for nothing."QOr if theyâ€™ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, butâ€¦ no promises."^My POINT is that if you donâ€™t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone."]Youâ€™re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose."<Listen, I donâ€™t know.

Ones like this."NWell, some archaeological teams went to study them a couple decades back."yAnd then they found the Regis, and the rich mineral veins, and the ruins, and they figured they could leverage that."{We got some corporate backing from Andris and Mavis, and boom: Team Chasm.

Best days of my life."oI just wanted to study the Regis, and with their power, nobody could tell me no. Funny how that works out.")You make it sound so pure and noble."bI was curious. Wanted answers. I got them â€“ who could tell me no with Regidrago at my side?"YNot to mention the full might of Team Chasm, 'cause my research was VERY profitable."QIâ€™m getting to that, but also, hey, it could come in handy some day, yeah?"5As I was saying: we found the five lesser Regis."\It took me years, but I deciphered their inscriptions and understood their true nature."JThat led us to Regigigas, and at that point we were cooking with gas."RGigas was stronger than the rest of the Regis put together, and smarter, too."|Shape the earth, revert it back to some kind of primordial clay. Create seals and wards that nothing could get through."2And, yeah, it could throw a mean Giga Impact."iIt could doâ€¦ other things, too. We found a way to make it create ethereal PokÃ©mon with its power.";They were hostile, powerful â€“ had to be locked away."}And then by the time Yezera kicked down our door and told us to stop, she was basically just confirming what we already knew."pWe were playing with fire. If we kept using Regigigas, we ran the very real chance of destroying the world."`Or at least permanently changing it. So we put each Regi back in their tomb and went legit."iThe tombs were reinforced, of course â€“ just about nothing can get through the minor Regi chambers."KGigasâ€™s chamber can only be opened by the other five Regis together."_I donâ€™t know. She agreed with us: it was too dangerous. We were criminals, not lunatics."MI know thingsâ€¦ havenâ€™t been great for her, but this? This is insane."[Who knows. We knew some groups were trying to get them back â€“ they always have been."PBut succeeding? There was no way. Impossible. Butâ€¦ apparently Yezera can."*â€¦Probably. They might already have."nGigasâ€™s chamber is deep down, though, and if they havenâ€™t broken the seal yet, itâ€™d be for nothing."QOr if theyâ€™ve resealed it. I can try and scout it out, butâ€¦ no promises."^My POINT is that if you donâ€™t help out, you better get used to the look of white stone."]Youâ€™re gonna be seeing a whole lot more of it if someone tells Regigigas to let loose."<Listen, I donâ€™t know.

I want to ensure the most valuable things are kept for the longest."Youâ€™d be third-to-last."^Oh, if I could only wrap my arms around you and take you with me. All the way to the end." Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m from, of course â€“ end of the line. You deserve better than that... but so do I, and Iâ€™d like to have one good child to keep me company."YOh, donâ€™t take it personally. Kids need to learn to grow up fast where Iâ€™m from."?Iâ€™ve made sure society is very... regimented. Practical."eWhen everythingâ€™s coming to a halt, you canâ€™t really afford the luxury of teenage rebellion."dIâ€™m a specter, \PN. My timeline is crumbling to ash. I donâ€™t know if it even really exists."Iâ€™ll either return there shortly, or cease to be. Give me this small mercy of being able to see my child again â€“ the child I wish Iâ€™d had."D...Our time is just about up. A word of advice: ditch the girl."5Sheâ€™s a liability, and sheâ€™ll drag you down."‡She doesnâ€™t deserve half the kindness sheâ€™s gotten, and the other half shouldâ€™ve been revoked to shape her into something better."}...What? Do you think I donâ€™t have my own Yezera? I said youâ€™d be third for a reason. Iâ€™m very proud of my second."–This oneâ€™s beyond repair, though. You deserve better than a girl thatâ€™d destroy the world over her social anxiety. Sheâ€™s quite literally insane."}Get rid of her and go back home to your Mavis. Sheâ€™ll love you even more now that youâ€™ve proven yourself so cleanly."Sheâ€™ll give you a role in life to fulfill, and protect you forever. Even to the end of the world, youâ€™ll have a place."A place... second-to-last."9Say hi to her for me. Love you, \PN. You deserve it."Iâ€™m sorry!"ƒIâ€™m so sorry.

Youâ€™ve got a spark to you. Will you listen to me?"0Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you."[How do I explain itâ€¦ well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate."_Weâ€™re distant from the perfect moment of creation. Weâ€™ve kind of taken over the world."UNo respect for our elders â€“ the primordial PokÃ©mon that created the universe."zYezeraâ€™s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more."kDonâ€™t call me insane. Although Iâ€™m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term."QIâ€™m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices. For example: you."EI really do like you, butâ€¦ we all have to sacrifice sometimes."MGodlike PokÃ©mon are now treated as not much more than beasts of burden."MAvatars are destroyed at will because theyâ€™re â€œthreats to humans.â€"\The world has lost all respect, the divine essence from creation diluted and destroyed."NAnd since you seem to be no different, I can take some joy in this fight."‰Arceus created the world. It is pure, and perfect, and resetting the world back to its original form will let us be pure and perfect too."BIâ€™d like to see myself blessed by the grace of our creator.")Iâ€™d like to see you that way, too."In time."@For now, Iâ€™ve been ordered to remove you. Shall we dance?")Good. I knew I saw something in you."BSome spark of faith. Iâ€™m aâ€¦ very good judge of character."ˆIâ€™d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So weâ€™ll fight. Donâ€™t take it personally."Oh. Was I too forward?"HMy emotions tend to get the better of me. Iâ€™m almost heartbroken."%Well, I suppose I am a stranger."€Fortunately, Iâ€™ve been sent to ensure you make it no farther, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.".Hello, friend. Yezera wishes to be alone."NTo that end, I have been sent, and graciously afforded a titan to aid me."`Before we attend to your removal, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?"RI would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position."Thank you for your time."_Yezeraâ€™s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation."oModern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world â€“ the modern world."It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge."#This is the only way to do so."vWithout the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices."PNow our time for conversation is up, however. Regice, please do the honors."AAll persons who attempt to advance civilization should care."HUniversal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society."\That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge."\Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then."<Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era."8We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity."\From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge."@And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power."YConsider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me."|I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you."xWe will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business. Let us commence."II find this highly unfortunate. You will be left behind by progress."NIf you would prefer to retain your ignorance, however, I cannot help you.",Prepare yourself. Regice, if you would."4Yo. Figureâ€™d, uh, yeah, that youâ€™d be here."bYezeraâ€™s here. You keep running into her. She, uh, doesnâ€™t really want to talk right now."0I got a job to do, but, uh, not keen on it." So you want to hear us out?"]Swear weâ€™ve got some good reasons. Even if Iâ€™m not that good at putting it in words."=Oh. Thatâ€™s good. Great. Honestly didnâ€™t expect that."HWell, I just figure weâ€™ve done a lot of ordering PokÃ©mon around.">Maybe itâ€™s time to even up the footing a bit, yâ€™know?"8We can all kinda make up for whatever we did wrong."mThe others have their reasons, but, uh, this is mine. Make a world where we can be forgiven. You get it?"(Well â€“ fine. You know what? Fine."bI donâ€™t need your permission, and we certainly donâ€™t need your help. Regice. Do â€˜em in."Zâ€¦You so sure? Takes a lot of pushing to train a team that strong in so little time."4But, yeah, no, I get it. Why would you help us?"?Rich brat. Maybe we can beat some responsibility into you."NUh. Donâ€™t really know how to break it to you. Youâ€¦ donâ€™t have time."EFor one, weâ€™ve already just about won. For two â€“ think fast!"(Regice, sweep â€˜em off their feet!"*Oh. Didnâ€™t, uh, really expect that.":Figured you were kind of a stuck-up brat. No offense."=Well, good. Maybe weâ€™ll be side by side one day, yeah?"5But, uh, for nowâ€¦ Iâ€™m supposed to fight you."HSo, uh, sorry â€“ ah, what am I saying, we live for this. Ready up."Yeah, I guess that tracks."#Fine. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s fine."5I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways."iOdds are Regice isnâ€™t gonna stick around much longer, so letâ€™s make it count. Try your best, eh?"-Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess."IIâ€™ve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours."cBut, umâ€¦ I still donâ€™t know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?"BWelp. Listen, uh, Makyaâ€™s kinda in a weird place right now."]Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda justâ€¦ got away with it?"So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans canâ€™t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are."KWouldâ€™ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didnâ€™t."[So weâ€™re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of PokÃ©mon."Is it? Is it!"AAm I insane for wanting some damn PUNISHMENT in this world?!"DWell, guess what. If people wonâ€™t give me it, Iâ€™ll MAKE it.""And Iâ€™ve got just the tool!"%It is simple, you â€“ you idiot!"aI can track down every ex-Chasm criminal and haul them up to the courts myself if I have to!"UThey just wonâ€™t do anything if I did! So I have to do things personally, yeah?" Sorry. Nothingâ€¦ personal."	Yes!"MTheyâ€™re noble and pure and â€“ and â€“ and theyâ€™d never let me down!"/Unlike you! And everyone else around here!"JYou want to see? Câ€™mon. See what kind of justice PokÃ©mon can give!"Oh. Ah-hah."LKinda got myself a bit worked up thereâ€¦ welp, no harm, no foul, yeah?"â€¦Nah, thatâ€™s stupid."^Iâ€™m not gonna waste this chance. Iâ€™ve got a Regi. Youâ€™re a prodigy. Letâ€™s RUMBLE!"Urgh, you make me so mad!")Nobody will frickinâ€™ listen to me!"
Fine."Yâ€™know, fine, whatever."?You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve."ARegice â€“ your service has ended. If you would go, then go."YSo it returns to its resting placeâ€¦ no matter. It has done all I desired and more."%As for you, we shall meet again."YWhen and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this."8Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.""Seems Regiceâ€™s 'bout spent."ODidnâ€™t exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but themâ€™s the breaks.".Figure itâ€™s headinâ€™ back to its home."eOne last thing, since you seem â€˜bout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and Iâ€™ll find you."=And it wonâ€™t just be for some play fight with animals."sGâ€™evening, kid. Iâ€™ll be seeinâ€™ you. Keep in mind how nice it feels to be havinâ€™ all your bones intact."9Au revoir, Regice. Enjoy your entombment, I suppose."XAnd as for you, Iâ€™m breathless. Speechless. Youâ€™re even better than I imagined."OIf youâ€™d like to stop your pointless struggling against us, tell Yezera."4Weâ€™d love to have you. Until we meet againâ€¦"2I surmise Regice will now return to its tomb."SThe titans are temperamental and ill-suited to existence outside their crypts."0It is of no matter. Our victory comes soon."JYezera may be displeased in my performance, but she is understanding."GIn the end, this will make no difference. Thank you for your time."See ya, Regice."Ah, who am I kidding."cIf either of us is gonna see it again, itâ€™ll be you. Couldnâ€™t really hold a candle to you."UHad to try anyways, just for Yezera. And Iâ€™m gonna have to do it again, right?"VGood practice, I guess. Well, think about it â€“ everything, yâ€™know? Iâ€™m out."U*sigh* So long, Regice. You never really were my type, anyways, so head on home."HAnd as for YOU, well, next time we talk itâ€™ll be in a fair world!"MIf it isnâ€™t, then, uh, Iâ€™ll have to buy us a liâ€™l more time, 'kay?"FUntil then, Iâ€™ve got judgment to be a-judging. So long, "hero.""No."	Yes."I'll listen."Don't need it."No, I donâ€™t."That's tenuous."I'll think about it."
I do."Fine, talk."Not interested in talking."I know who you are."Don't threaten me."Clear."Wish that already."I'm with you."Alright, fine."Go away."That's insane."Degenerate?"Arceus's bosom?"That's fair."Sure, talk."Don't really care."It isn't worth it."Who cares?"Society will crumble."Good point."Don't care."You're wrong."I'm not guilty."

The titans have served their purpose."LI come then with a simple inquiry: will you not listen to my reasoning?"PThank you. Our goal is naught less than a complete reordering of the world."<My comrades have their own motives, but mine is simple."„The world at present is mercurial and deceptive. Human culture and technology serves as naught but a veil disguising ultimate truth."uOnly the realm of ancient myth, tended by gods, untouched by humans, might let us perceive it. Do you not agree?"tHow disappointing, to dismiss it outright. If you have no eye for truth, then we have nothing else to speak of."_Forgive me this act of passion, but I expect a titanâ€™s wrath may settle my raging heart."Regice, heed my command."RTo the contrary: it has adamant support, if only one ruminates on the matter."`Such wavering faith is nigh-useless for my purposes, alas. We require unflinching devotion."_*sigh* I would be forsaking my duty if I did not stall you at the least. Prepare yourself."lI should encourage you to do so.

That is intolerable to us."UThis shall be no decisive victory of mine, but I cannot let you pass unhindered."/â€¦I should very much like to believe you."`If you speak truth, then I bid you repeat your convictions to Yezera herself next you meet."oShe can see the machinations of your heart more clearly than I.

If only it were under better circumstances."]Regice and I have unfortunately been told to make sure Yezera has no unwelcome visitors."xBefore that, thoughâ€¦ I know youâ€™re more than a pretty face. Youâ€™ve got a spark to you. Will you listen to me?"0Aww. I knew I had a good feeling about you."[How do I explain itâ€¦ well, I hate to use the word, but modern society is degenerate."_Weâ€™re distant from the perfect moment of creation. Weâ€™ve kind of taken over the world."UNo respect for our elders â€“ the primordial PokÃ©mon that created the universe."zYezeraâ€™s going to reset this world back to its origins. And then humanity will be in the bosom of Arceus once more."kDonâ€™t call me insane. Although Iâ€™m sure this arrogant, faithless civilization would use that term."QIâ€™m merely devout, and devotion means making sacrifices.

Shall we dance?")Good. I knew I saw something in you."BSome spark of faith. Iâ€™m aâ€¦ very good judge of character."ˆIâ€™d love to just talk with you for a while, but I was explicitly instructed to stop you. So weâ€™ll fight. Donâ€™t take it personally."Oh. Was I too forward?"HMy emotions tend to get the better of me. Iâ€™m almost heartbroken."%Well, I suppose I am a stranger."€Fortunately, Iâ€™ve been sent to ensure you make it no farther, so I have a convenient vent for all these feelings of rejection.".Hello, friend. Yezera wishes to be alone."NTo that end, I have been sent, and graciously afforded a titan to aid me."`Before we attend to your removal, however, may I interest you in a short, frank discussion?"RI would rather like to try to convince you of the legitimacy of our position."Thank you for your time."_Yezeraâ€™s goal is to recreate the conditions of the world shortly following its creation."oModern science has attained almost complete understanding and mastery over the world â€“ the modern world."It cannot, however, understand the past. By reverting existence, we may study the universe from its conception and obtain universal knowledge."#This is the only way to do so."vWithout the reversion, humanity will never attain complete understanding of the universe. It is worth all prices."PNow our time for conversation is up, however. Regice, please do the honors."AAll persons who attempt to advance civilization should care."HUniversal knowledge is a prerequisite for an all- powerful society."\That is my goal. That is the goal of all science: to know, and to apply that knowledge."\Your ignorance implies discussion will get us nowhere. Let us dispense with such, then."<Knowledge will be retained into the new primordial era."8We can rebuild at least small enclaves of humanity."\From there our analysis and conquest will begin: a new society with absolute knowledge."@And, stemming from this absolute knowledge, absolute power."YConsider it. In the mean time, there is the business I mentioned earlier. Excuse me."|I am glad you have the wisdom to agree. If you should wish to support us in our endeavors, I will be happy to have you."xWe will fight for a more enlightened era. For now, however, I must slow you. Business is business.

Thatâ€™sâ€¦ itâ€™s fine."5I came here to beat the crap out of you anyways."iOdds are Regice isnâ€™t gonna stick around much longer, so letâ€™s make it count. Try your best, eh?"-Well. Had to happen eventually, I guess."IIâ€™ve kinda sorta been planning what to say for the past few hours."cBut, umâ€¦ I still donâ€™t know. So can I just say what comes to mind and hope you understand?"BWelp. Listen, uh, Makyaâ€™s kinda in a weird place right now."]Team Chasm ran roughshod over this whole region and then kinda justâ€¦ got away with it?"So, uh, yeah, if you ever wanted proof that humans canâ€™t get even the most black-and-white justice right, there you are."KWouldâ€™ve been simple to fix that little screw-up. But they didnâ€™t."[So weâ€™re taking the power away from humans, and putting it in the hands of PokÃ©mon."Is it?

Fine."Yâ€™know, fine, whatever."?You get what everyone else I fight gets. What you deserve."ARegice â€“ your service has ended.

It has done all I desired and more."%As for you, we shall meet again."YWhen and where, fate shall decide, though I think I know where we shall settle this."8Do not pursue me. Your audience with Yezera awaits.""Seems Regiceâ€™s 'bout spent."ODidnâ€™t exactly expect them to be so squirrelly, but themâ€™s the breaks.".Figure itâ€™s headinâ€™ back to its home."eOne last thing, since you seem â€˜bout ready to see Yez again: you hurt her and Iâ€™ll find you."=And it wonâ€™t just be for some play fight with animals."sGâ€™evening, kid.

Guess I never shouldâ€™ve figured I could beat you."$Iâ€™ll be rooting for you, kid."GShouldnâ€™t call you kid, I guess. Barely recognize you, honestly."5Good luck. Even though I doubt youâ€™ll need it."3Oh, well, look what the Shinx dragged in. \PN."LEight years ago, I lost to Yezera, and because of that Team Chasm fell."sIâ€™ve been training since then. Iâ€™m planning on redeeming myself among the scattered remnants of your team."rNothing personal â€“ I actually rather appreciate you. Youâ€™re just the most convenient point of comparison."MNow, letâ€™s see if I canâ€™t snuff out this childâ€™s hopes and dreams."k*sigh* Iâ€™ll need to see my dentist. I think I lost an inch of enamel to grinding my teeth that hard."DWhat is it about you that makes you so infuriatingly adaptable?"FFine. Fine! Iâ€™ll resign myself to the only thing Iâ€™m good at."|Iâ€™ll turn this region into an economic powerhouse, become even richer than Mavis, and buy LuxTech out from under her."^Enjoy my petty revenge. And good luck with the Championship or whatever. Iâ€™m done here."$Hello! Hale and hearty, I hope?"{Oh, rest easy, I have no interest in the title. No, I am here because a champion is in the making, and they must be tested!"wTested with fire! Tested with toxin! Tested with the unyielding agony that only the truest champion can withstand!",Now embrace it, and show me your worth!"NBlazing, brilliant, bearing both mercy and ruthlessness in equal measure!"_Ah ha ha! Iâ€™ll bow out now â€“ now the role of the testing solvent belongs to you alone."7Enjoy it! Revel in it! Iâ€™ll be cheering for you."8Oh, itâ€™s you! Iâ€™ve been waiting for this fight."PYou would not BELIEVE the time I put into training after you got our badge!"~If youâ€™re thinking Iâ€™m just another rando, think again. ZoÃ© and I got trained by Yezera herself back when it was her gym!"cThen I doubled down and went extra hard on training after you showed up. You are NOT prepared!"You WERE prepared! Wow!"GThat wasâ€¦ uhâ€¦ yeah! Still got a long ways to go, I guess! Wow!"†Iâ€™ll remember that one for a long time to come, lemme tell you. Gonna keep training, keep moving, keep working my way up the ladder."GGlad to see you. Keep rocking, 'kay? Canâ€™t wait for the rematch!"Same here."Oh, I care."Won't go easy on you."We don't have to fight."Good luck."Good idea."Don't."Mavis...[}"*è½»ç¬‘å£°*"8é—»åˆ°äº†å—ï¼Ÿè¿™é‡Œæœ‰ä¸€è‚¡ä¹¦å‘†å­çš„å‘³é“ã€‚"Då‡†å¤‡å¥½äº†å—ï¼Œå°é¬¼ï¼Ÿæˆ‘è¦æŠŠä½ æ‰£è¿›ä¸‹ä¸€ä¸ªåå¹´ã€‚"/ç›å¾·ï¼Œæˆ‘ç«Ÿç„¶è¾“ç»™äº†è¿™ä¸ªå°é¬¼..."å˜¿ï¼Œå°é¬¼ã€‚";æˆ‘ä¸ä¼šéª—ä½ è¯´ï¼Œä»æ¥æ²¡æœ‰è®¡åˆ’æˆä¸ºå† å†›ã€‚"5æˆ‘ä»¬çš„ç›®æ ‡åœ¨æŸäº›æ–¹é¢å°±æ˜¯ä¸€æ ·çš„ã€‚"Gå°±æ­¤ç»“æŸä¹Ÿæ˜¯å¿…ç„¶ï¼Œä¸è¿‡ï¼Œæˆ‘å¹¶ä¸æ€ä¹ˆåœ¨ä¹ç»“æœã€‚"#æˆ‘åªæ˜¯æƒ³...å¾—åˆ°è§£è„±ã€‚">å“¦ï¼Œæ˜¯å—ï¼Ÿä½ ç»ˆäºæ„è¯†åˆ°æ•´ä»¶äº‹çš„è’è°¬äº†ï¼Ÿ",ä½†ï¼ŒæŠ±æ­‰...æˆ‘ä¾ç„¶æ˜¯ä¸ªæ··è›‹ã€‚"_é‚£æ˜¯ä½ çš„æƒåˆ©ï¼Œæ˜¯ä½ çš„é€‰æ‹©ä¸ç”Ÿæ´»ï¼Œè€Œä¸”ï¼Œæœ‰å¾ˆå¤šè§£å†³é—®é¢˜çš„æ–¹æ³•ã€‚">æˆ‘ä¼šç¡®ä¿ä»Šå¤©ï¼Œç»™ä½ ä¸€åœºå€¼å¾—ç§°èµçš„æˆ˜æ–—ã€‚"Gæˆ‘ä¹Ÿä¸å¸Œæœ›ä½ æ”¾æ°´ï¼Œè¿™ä¸æ˜¯ä¸€åœºæ— å…³ç´§è¦çš„ç»ƒä¹ ã€‚"Mè¿™æˆ–è®¸æ˜¯æœ€ä¸ºå…³é”®çš„ä¸€åœºï¼Œè€Œä¸”ï¼Œæˆ‘ä¼šäº«å—è¿™ä¸ªè¿‡ç¨‹ã€‚"&ä¸ºä»€ä¹ˆï¼Ÿæ‰“è¿˜æ˜¯è¦æ‰“çš„ã€‚"Pè¿™æ˜¯æ•´ä»¶äº‹ä¸­æœ€æœ‰è¶£çš„éƒ¨åˆ†ï¼Œä¹Ÿæ˜¯ç»“æŸä¸€åˆ‡çš„å¿…è¦ä¸€ç¯ã€‚"\è€Œä¸”...æˆ‘çŸ¥é“æ¢…ç»´æ–¯ä¼šçœ‹ç€æˆ‘ä»¬è¿™åœºå†³æ–—ï¼Œè¿™è®©æˆ‘æ„Ÿè§‰æœ‰ç‚¹æ¶å¿ƒã€‚"Mæˆ‘ä¸å¸Œæœ›é‚£äº›ç³Ÿçƒ‚çš„äº‰æ–—ï¼Œç·æ±¡æˆ‘æƒ³è¯æ˜è‡ªå·±çš„å†³å¿ƒã€‚"Pä½†æ²¡åŠæ³•ï¼Œæœ€åä¸€æˆ˜...æˆ‘ä¸ä¼šå…è®¸è‡ªå·±åƒä¹‹å‰é‚£æ ·è¾“æ‰ã€‚"zè€Œæ˜¯ä»¥æˆ‘è‡ªå·±çš„æ–¹å¼â€œæƒœè´¥â€ï¼Œå“ˆå“ˆï¼Œè®©æˆ‘çœ‹çœ‹ä½ çš„æ°´å‡†å§ï¼Œ\PNï¼Œå‘æˆ‘å±•ç¤ºçœŸæ­£çš„è‡ªå·±ï¼"#...è¾“å®Œçš„æ„Ÿè§‰å¤ªæ£’äº†ã€‚"Gæ­å–œä½ ï¼Œæˆä¸ºäº†å† å†›ã€‚è¿™å¯æ˜¯ç›¸å½“äº†ä¸èµ·çš„æˆå°±ã€‚"Sæˆ‘ä¸æ˜¯åªçŸ¥é“åŸ‹å¤´è‹¦å¹²çš„æ‡µå­ï¼ŒçŸ¥é“ä½ è¿˜æœ‰å…¶ä»–äº‹è¦å¤„ç†ã€‚"Vä½†ç°åœ¨ä½œä¸ºä½ çš„ç«äº‰è€…ï¼Œè¿˜æ˜¯å…ˆæ­å–œä½ å…¬å¹³å…¬æ­£åœ°å‡»è´¥äº†æˆ‘ã€‚"Mæ¥ä¸‹æ¥ï¼Œä½œä¸ºå…„å¼Ÿï¼Œæˆ‘ä¼°è®¡å¾—æœ‰æ®µæ—¶é—´è§ä¸åˆ°å½¼æ­¤äº†ã€‚"hæ¥ä¸‹æ¥æˆ‘ä¼šåœ¨æ‰€æœ‰ç¤¾äº¤åª’ä½“ä¸Šï¼Œå±è”½æ‰æ¢…ç»´æ–¯ï¼Œç„¶åé€‰æ‹©è‡ªå·±è¦èµ°çš„æ–¹å‘ã€‚"

That includes from ace trainers like you."_I know you canâ€™t stand that, so... I guess we gotta fight. Sorry... but Iâ€™m not sorry."-I donâ€™t. Not most of the time anyways."jIâ€™m trying my best to make things right. Can you say the same? Going around keeping the status quo?"hIs this the world you want? I guess youâ€™re a rich brat, so... yeah. Lifeâ€™s easy, lifeâ€™s good."IHmph. Iâ€™m gonna try and make it a little harder for you, if I can."+Sorry. Guess Iâ€™m a spiteful bastard."xNo! Iâ€™ll fail â€“ Iâ€™ll gladly fail â€“ but Iâ€™m not about to give up. Iâ€™ve got friends that need protecting."cIâ€™ve got stuff in my past I need to make up for. And Iâ€™ve got a world that needs building."A better one â€“ one thatâ€™s more equal, more fair. Sorry it isnâ€™t what you want, but I wonâ€™t just roll over for you."You ready?"%...Hey. So, uh, this is it, huh?"]Youâ€™re, like, not gonna have a change of mind? No justice? No fairness? No punishment?"~Oh, who am I kidding â€“ youâ€™re Tamarindâ€™s lapdog. Youâ€™ve been doing her dirty work since, like, literally day one!"8Guess what that means! Thatâ€™s right: time to pay!"zThatâ€™s what they all said. Youâ€™re not a team grunt! Youâ€™re just, like, a temporarily inconvenienced mastermind!"dUgh, youâ€™re all the same. Well, Iâ€™ve chewed through a lotta grunts. No different this time!"'Nope! But I really really want to!"zTamarindâ€™s out of my reach, but youâ€™re, like, the second-best thing. So câ€™mere so I can give you a bloody nose."7If you were sorry youâ€™d stop fighting me, idiot!"Youâ€™re such a â€“ such a dolt! How can I get it through your thick skull that youâ€™re the bad guy? Can I beat it into you? Wanna find out?"ˆOh, I swear, Iâ€™ll roll up these sleeves and deck you myself if I have to! I swear, if you chip my nails Iâ€™m gonna kill you for real!"=Câ€™mon, boys and girls! Weâ€™ve got a beatdown to give!"Ah. Hah. Hahaha!"}So be it! My reading is complete â€“ the scars of this battle left in the ancient stone here are a portent of things to come."TCan you suppose what it says? It says I shall lose here, and you shall triumph.".Hah! Fate has a sense of humor, it seems."`Go on. Continue yet deeper. I know my place, and will not stand against destiny any longer."qFor my sanity, I will refrain from attempting to divine the results of your future battles. I take my leave."%Awww, kid, you shouldnâ€™t have."xGoinâ€™ all-out? On yours truly? Iâ€™m touched. Not even half-honest, either â€“ itâ€™s a treat seeinâ€™ you fight."~Go on. Yez is waitinâ€™ for you. I ainâ€™t too hung up on this whole scheme. Yezâ€™ll turn out fine either way â€“ tough girl."RTougher than me, I swear. So you go do what ya got planned, whatever that is."WIf ya hurt her, theyâ€™ll never find the body, blah blah blah, you know the drill."AGood luck, kid. Come find me some time afterwards, yâ€™hear?"0...Go. Leave. Now, before I lose my temper."dIs that really what the fate of the universe hangs on? Our relative skill in training PokÃ©mon?"fItâ€™s ridiculous! Itâ€™s idiotic! I canâ€™t believe â€“ go! Just go! I should... I should... go."~Noted. Excuse me â€“ I fear I may not have provided adequate resistance. I now find myself lacking any means to challenge you."m...Understood. I have no recourse but to retreat. I wish you the worst of luck in your future endeavors."KIf you will permit me to leave, I will no longer impede your progress."4Goodbye, friend. I hope never to see you again."Damn it. Damn it!"UI â€“ yeah, thatâ€™s how it goes. Never was as good as you. Any of you hotshots."gPushed my PokÃ©mon hard to try and get there, and now look at me. Trying to make up for all of it.":Sorry, everyone. Sorry, Manaphy. I guess that was it."VLetâ€™s get yâ€™all back to a PokÃ©center, OK? Get you fixed up... Iâ€™m sorry..."AUgh! Iâ€™m â€“ fine! Ow. I think I took a stray shot... oof."ƒLook me in the damn eyes, you dumb grunt! If I was â€“ ow â€“ if I wasnâ€™t... if I wasnâ€™t... Iâ€™m feeling a little lightheaded."RIs this why they black out after losing...? Iâ€™m gonna... I canâ€™t do this."fGo do whatever it is you think youâ€™re, like, actually accomplishing. You stupid, stupid dolt..."{But youâ€™re pickinâ€™ a fight with Yez, so Iâ€™m gonna leave you with some bruises. You 'bout ready? Put 'em up, kid."]You want to get to her, ya go through me. Call me clichÃ© but thatâ€™s my line about it.")I shouldâ€™ve known she was useless."jYezera was THIS close. So close to getting everything she wanted. All she had to do was not tell you."}She had to not be human. Her one redeeming quality: her inhumanity. And now she went and betrayed that, and with it, me."0Apparently. Itâ€™s sickening, to be honest."tThe same shallow, stupid desires as everyone else. I guess Iâ€™m just as much of an idiot for believing in her."Yes. Good. For. Her."fUnfortunately, it isnâ€™t so good for her grand plan, nor mine. I hope the catharsis is worth it."5Yes, she did. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve realized that."(Fine. I hope I never see you again."HBut, well, Iâ€™ll take care of her once the regression is complete.";You, on the other hand, Iâ€™ll deal with now. So long."XDo you want me to dispose of your team again? Go on ahead. I can delay you all day."No!"#I want it! I want it so badly!"EIâ€™d â€“ you donâ€™t understand. You donâ€™t understand at all."(How sickened I am at you creatures.".Fine. You win. Go rendezvous with Yezera."'I hope she puts you in your place."AIf you ever see me again, it wonâ€™t end well for one of us."&I'm getting the hell out of here."No."	Yes."You stopping me?"Get out of my way."You think you can?"Please, just shut up."Yeah, it does."Don't wanna do this.""Dolled up?""I'll dance if I want to."Not forcing you."Yeah, I am."A poem? For me?"Still creepy, huh?"Not happening."Don't want to fight."Wait, "non-zero?""Talked too long already."No, I can't."This is wrong."Don't hate yourself."Just give up."I'm not her lapdog."Do we have to?"Sorry."Fine, bring it on."She's human."Good for her."Yeah, she did."!Shut up.

Youâ€™ve got such... clarity."ƒWhat a gleaming light in this dreary cave. Why, that could almost be poetic! If only we had a hopeless romantic to write that down."QAlas, Iâ€™ll be too busy directing my passions into carving your team apart."\Of course! Youâ€™re such a brilliant spark in this region. You deserve odes... sonnets."†On the other hand, the fact that youâ€™re here now against me instead of alongside me means that youâ€™re not as special as I thought."MNo faith.

Unfortunately, I can tell from your tone that we are, in fact, about to duel."zI am unwilling to let you go further, and I am unwilling to lose. Please understand... and please consider conceding."QThat is the most I am willing to say pertaining to your odds against Yezera."‰She is conventionally regarded as unbeatable when she applies herself, though I am aware that you have broken that convention repeatedly."INow, may we end the discussion of theory and add another data point?"OExcuse my verbosity. If you would like to go straight to our duel, we can."gI would not insult your intelligence by pretending we will not fight. That much should be evident."Shall we?"=Oh, uh, hey. Listen: Iâ€™m gonna cut right to the chase."2You beat me once.

My reading is complete â€“ the scars of this battle left in the ancient stone here are a portent of things to come."TCan you suppose what it says?

I know my place, and will not stand against destiny any longer."qFor my sanity, I will refrain from attempting to divine the results of your future battles.

Yez is waitinâ€™ for you. I ainâ€™t too hung up on this whole scheme. Yezâ€™ll turn out fine either way â€“ tough girl."RTougher than me, I swear. So you go do what ya got planned, whatever that is."WIf ya hurt her, theyâ€™ll never find the body, blah blah blah, you know the drill."AGood luck, kid. Come find me some time afterwards, yâ€™hear?"0...Go. Leave. Now, before I lose my temper."dIs that really what the fate of the universe hangs on? Our relative skill in training PokÃ©mon?"fItâ€™s ridiculous! Itâ€™s idiotic! I canâ€™t believe â€“ go! Just go! I should... I should... go."~Noted. Excuse me â€“ I fear I may not have provided adequate resistance. I now find myself lacking any means to challenge you."m...Understood. I have no recourse but to retreat. I wish you the worst of luck in your future endeavors."KIf you will permit me to leave, I will no longer impede your progress."4Goodbye, friend. I hope never to see you again."Damn it. Damn it!"UI â€“ yeah, thatâ€™s how it goes. Never was as good as you. Any of you hotshots."gPushed my PokÃ©mon hard to try and get there, and now look at me.

Call me clichÃ© but thatâ€™s my line about it.")I shouldâ€™ve known she was useless."jYezera was THIS close. So close to getting everything she wanted. All she had to do was not tell you."}She had to not be human. Her one redeeming quality: her inhumanity. And now she went and betrayed that, and with it, me."0Apparently. Itâ€™s sickening, to be honest."tThe same shallow, stupid desires as everyone else. I guess Iâ€™m just as much of an idiot for believing in her."Yes. Good. For. Her."fUnfortunately, it isnâ€™t so good for her grand plan, nor mine. I hope the catharsis is worth it."5Yes, she did. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve realized that."(Fine. I hope I never see you again."HBut, well, Iâ€™ll take care of her once the regression is complete.";You, on the other hand, Iâ€™ll deal with now.

You want me to explain this? Velenz? *shrug*">Oh, I know. But youâ€™re the one standing in front of me."LCute. Never shouldâ€™ve brought a hero here. Heroes are always trouble.")*snort* Sure, kid. Whatever you say."vI know youâ€™re here with that girl â€“ Candy? Helenaâ€™s had her trackers keeping an eye on her for a while now."JShe hasnâ€™t been causing too much trouble, though, so we let her go."dListen, we ran this region. Do you know what that means â€“ taken any political science lately?"JIt means a monopoly on violence. Every government works the same way."BOh, you can call me a tyrant if you want, but Iâ€™m no thief."Yep! And a damn good one."fNot an absolute one, though â€“ Andris and Helena made up the other two corners of that triangle."JNot to mention the extensive bureaucracy of Team Chasm at its height."@From who? This was a lawless frontier before we came along."VOnly holdouts like Novo truly resisted unification into the larger establishment."hThe benefits of being a tyrant. If people are getting in the way, you can convince them to... stop."/Câ€™mon. You were raised better than that."8We still rule the region because we ARE the region."Weâ€™ve got old grunts everywhere whoâ€™ll still follow orders if I give them. Helena has her trackers, so weâ€™ve got an intelligence agency."dAnd sheâ€™s got her claws in LuxTechâ€™s outpost here, so economic development is guided by us."XWe were a big organization. All-encompassing. And we had to be: lots of work to do."uOver just a few decades, we imposed law on this place, created entire new settlements, made it rich and vibrant."ƒWe quintupled the population. We dealt with outbreaks, infighting, earthquakes. We secured the support of multiple major companies."~And at the end of the day, we managed to go legit, integrate with the Prizcan government, and arenâ€™t even hated for it."_If you want to try and do even a tenth of that without resorting to violence, be my guest."‹We punished people, which youâ€™d call assault. We imprisoned them, which youâ€™d call kidnapping. We taxed them, which youâ€™d call theft."FOh, sure, people resisted us, but we only acted how a state does."ECandyâ€™s too young to have been around during Chasmâ€™s zenith."~Sheâ€™s got a childâ€™s notion of justice, and she thinks that performing her own little acts of violence fixes anything."GMaybe she should ask herself why almost everyoneâ€™s fine with us."	Yes."Andris did it for money."Helena did it for power."WAnd I did it so I could finally have the resources to properly research the Regis."ZEveryone in Team Chasm â€“ in any organization â€“ has their own reasons to be there."F...We can argue all day, kid. Youâ€™re not going to get anywhere."Let me put it this way:"’a lot of the PokÃ©mon Candy has â€œrescuedâ€ were given to Chasm grunts for combat purposes, but they ended up liking their new home plenty fine."PMaybe talking things out wouldâ€™ve resolved things better than theft, huh?"gBut I know you want to know. Whatâ€™s up with Velenz? Well, itâ€™s simple. We were trying to work."I canâ€™t work when Iâ€™m being attacked by wannabe heroes. When the power grid is being fried. When Ghost-types are being sent to haunt my lab.";We asked, repeatedly, for them to stop. They didnâ€™t."tSo I took Regigigas and had it carve up the bedrock around here, then dragged some avatars in for good measure."zThey couldnâ€™t prove it was us, but pretty soon they lost their base of operations, and that got the message across."LYes. Was. If theyâ€™d wanted to keep it, they couldâ€™ve left us alone."?Kid, have you ever gotten twelve hours of sleep in a week?"vThese â€œfreedom fightersâ€ were using every trick in the book. Constantly harrying us. Never a momentâ€™s rest.".Ugh. Makes me mad just thinking about it."I think so, yeah."NThatâ€™s how it goes. Warfare ainâ€™t pretty, but it exists for a reason."qI did what I did. And if someone wants to â€œbring me to justiceâ€ for it, I say: what does that even mean?"LIâ€™m breaking my back running this region, making it better every day."fYou want to throw me in prison? Make this place worse so you can have your petty revenge? Idiocy."SI know what I did, and Iâ€™m not going to do it again. Neither is anyone else."|...Now, kid.

Every government works the same way."BOh, you can call me a tyrant if you want, but Iâ€™m no thief."Yep!

Didnâ€™t expect to see me?"rIâ€™ve been, like, superglued to Tammyâ€™s side the past few months. Couldnâ€™t get away even if I wanted to."]But, like, I wouldnâ€™t miss it for the world, dummy!

No one could be disappointed with your performance."<But thereâ€™s someone you wish was here, isnâ€™t there?"^Never fear! A late entrance is a dramatic entrance, wouldnâ€™t you agree, darling?

it is young, it uses the nutrients that are stored in the seed on its back in order to grow."To support its weight, Ivysaur's legs and trunk grow thick and strong. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, it's a sign that the bud will bloom soon."_Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight."tFrom the time it is born, a flame burns at the tip of its tail. Its life would end if the flame were to go out."_In the rocky mountains where Charmeleon live, their fiery tails shine at night like stars."fIf Charizard becomes furious, the flame at the tip of its tail flares up in a whitish-blue color."Its shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling Squirtle to swim at high speeds."Its large tail is covered with rich, thick fur that deepens in color with age. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this PokÃ©mon's toughness in battle."dThe jets of water it spouts from the rocket cannons on its shell can punch through thick steel."Its voracious appetite compels it to devour leaves bigger than itself without hesitation. It releases a terribly strong odor from its antennae."hA steel-hard shell protects its tender body. It quietly endures hardships while awaiting evolution."dWater-repellent powder on its wings enables it to collect honey, even in the heaviest of rains."}Evolutionary power has supercharged its wings and their toxic scales, which turn to pure energy at the slightest provocation."fPredators not warned off by its brightly-colored body are jabbed with the toxic barb on its head."¢It remains virtually immobile while it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it busily prepares for evolution. This is evident from how hot its shell becomes."rIt prefers hit-and-run attacks using its powerful poison stingers, trying to evade blows to its fragile body."Its final evolution has sent its killer instinct into overdrive. It obeys its trainer unfailingly, but will grow impatient without a good fight."–It has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It can unerringly return home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."¤This PokÃ©mon flies around, patrolling its large territory. If its living space is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws."dIt spreads its gorgeous wings wide to intimidate enemies. It races through the skies at Mach 2."YCautious in the extreme, its hardy vitality lets it live in any kind of environment."iWith its long fangs, this surprisingly violent PokÃ©mon can gnaw away even thick concrete with ease."{It shows no interest in anything that isn't fresh. If you take it shopping with you, it will help you pick out ingredients."qIt makes its Rattata underlings gather food for it, dining solely on the most nutritious and delicious fare."vFarmers whose fields are troubled by bug PokÃ©mon appreciate Spearow for its vigorous appetite and look after it."‹Its long neck and elongated beak are ideal for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves this extended and skinny beak to pluck prey."’Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. Assuming this position allows it to quickly respond to a threat from any direction with a glare."jTransfixing prey with the face-like pattern on its belly, it binds and poisons the frightened victim."`It is not yet skilled at storing electricity. It may send out a jolt if amused or startled."fThis intelligent PokÃ©mon roasts hard berries with electricity to make them tender enough to eat."If it stores too much electricity, its behavior turns aggressive. To avoid this, it occasionally discharges excess energy and calms itself down."‚Rarely, a Pikachu grows to incredible size instead of evolving into Raichu. It can power settlements so long as it's fed properly."dIt can loose 100,000-volt bursts of electricity, instantly downing foes several times its size."ˆIt loves to bathe in the grit of dry, sandy areas. By sand bathing, this PokÃ©mon rids itself of dirt and moisture clinging to its body."xIts claws and horns often break off. The broken claws and horns can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields."nLife on mountains covered with deep snow has granted this PokÃ©mon a body of ice that's as hard as steel."It lives in snowy mountains on southern islands. When a blizzard rolls in, this PokÃ©mon hunkers down in the snow to avoid getting blown away."œIts highly toxic barbs are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied PokÃ©mon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn."›When Nidorina are with friends or family, they keep their barbs tucked away to prevent hurting each other. It becomes nervous if separated from the others."It pacifies offspring by placing them in the gaps between the spines on its back. The spines will never secrete poison while young are present."wIts large ears are flapped like wings when it is listening to distant sounds.

Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type.

You can catch these PokÃ©mon by throwing PokÃ© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"›Catching a PokÃ©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch PokÃ©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a PokÃ©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the PokÃ© Ball menu."Finding Wild PokÃ©mon"UUse the DexNav to get information on which PokÃ©mon are available where you are."Trades"Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for PokÃ©mon.

You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ƒMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A PokÃ©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ƒAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to PokÃ©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"Held items are items which you can give your PokÃ©mon to benefit them during battle.

You lose a battle if any of your PokÃ©mon faints. Fainted PokÃ©mon will revive in several turns."’1. Have as many PokÃ©mon as you can. 2. Level up your PokÃ©mon as much as you can. 3. Abuse type matchups. 4. Start battles with healthy PokÃ©mon."Team Size"–You can have a maximum of 6 PokÃ©mon with you at any time. This is known as your 'Team'. You can store extra PokÃ©mon using the PC in any PokÃ©Center."Levels"©Each PokÃ©mon has a level from 1 to 70. A PokÃ©mon's level determines its stats as well as what moves it could learn. Reaching high enough levels also unlocks Evolution."Types are strong or weak against other types. Having a variety of different types on your team helps you take advantage of these relationships."Healing your PokÃ©mon"¨PokÃ©mon are healed after a trainer battle. You can heal your PokÃ©mon at PokÃ©Centers between battles. You can often use the Aid Kit instead to save on traveling time."Who goes first?"‰In battle, the PokÃ©mon with the higher speed stat gets to use their move first. Some moves modify this. Speed ties are decided randomly."Attacking vs Status"~Attacking moves deal damage. Status moves do not. Status moves are notated by a Yin/Yang symbol (White and Black intermixing)."Physical vs Special"¤Attacking moves are split into Physical moves, and Special moves. Each of these categories uses different stats to determine how much damage is dealt to the target."Physical Moves"¥Physical moves are notated by the symbol of a smashing fist. Their damage is based on the Attack (Atk) stat of the attacker and the Defense (Def) stat of the target."Special Moves"«Special moves are notated by the symbol of a splash. Their damage is based on the Special Attack (Sp. Atk) of the attacker and the Special Defense (Sp. Def) of the target."Targeting"µMost moves target only a single PokÃ©mon, but many can target multiple PokÃ©mon at once. Some moves differ in how far they can target in the bigger battle styles (doubles, triples)."Move Types"£Every move has a type. Attacking moves deal different amounts of damage to different PokÃ©mon based on those PokÃ©mon's types. This is called 'type effectiveness'."Same-Type Bonus"šPokÃ©mon deal 50% more damage with moves the share a type with them. For example, a Raichu deals 50% more damage with an Electric move than a Normal move."Learning Moves"ŠPokÃ©mon learn new moves as they level up. They can also learn moves from the 'Move Tutors' who sit in the left side of every PokÃ©Center."Base Power"Moves with higher Base Power deal more damage. Some moves deal variable Base Power depending on the situation. Status moves have no base power."–Accuracy is a move's chance of hitting. Most moves have 100% accuracy. Some effects can raise accuracy to let you use low-accuracy moves consistently."Power Points"¢Power Points, or PP, is a number which limits how many times a move can be used. Healing at a PokÃ©Center, after a trainer battle or with the Aid Kit restores PP."—Each PokÃ©mon has type weakness and type resistances based on its own type. eg. Water deals double damage to Fire, and Fire deals half damage to Water."Type Combinations"±When a PokÃ©mon has two types, its type weaknesses and resistances multiply. A PokÃ©mon can be double weak or double resistant, or immune even though one of their types is weak."Normal Effective"SNormal Effective is the default effectiveness of all moves against a PokÃ©mon."Super Effective"USuper Effective moves deal double the damage compared to normal effective moves."Hyper Effective"ŠHyper Effective moves deal quadruple the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double weak to a type."Not Very Effective"VNot Very Effective moves deal half the damage compared to normal effective moves."Barely Effective"’Barely Effective moves deal one quarter the damage compared to normal effective moves. This happens when a PokÃ©mon is double resistant to a type."Ineffective"¯Ineffective moves deal no damage at all. This can happen if one of a PokÃ©mon's types has an immunity to the attacking move type, even if the other is neutral (or even weak!)."Looking Up Matchups"‘The 5th and 6th pages of a MasterDex entry show that PokÃ©mon's type matchups. Open the MasterDex in battle to check matchups if you're not sure."Psychic vs Steel"PPsychic is now Super-Effective vs Steel.

Think of insects scaring children."Grass resistances"KGrass now resists Fairy and Ghost. Think of incense warding off magic."Ice resistances"iIce now resists Flying and Ground. Ice is Super-Effective against those types, so it's only natural!"Other changes"`Rock resists Ice. Fairy resists Dragon. Fairy is neutral against Fire. Bug resists Psychic."Why Get More?"Having choices of PokÃ©mon is important when facing challenges. A team of six is a bare minimum--it's best to catch more and pull them from the PC as needed."Methods of Aquiring"›The three main methods of acquiring PokÃ©mon are using DexNav, catching them from the wild, and receiving them from other Trainers through gifts or trades."Catching Basics"®Wild PokÃ©mon will attack you if you walk through patches of grass, dark ground in caves, or other wild terrain. You can catch these PokÃ©mon by throwing PokÃ© Balls at them." Increase Catch Chance pt. 1"›Catching a PokÃ©mon isn't guaranteed. It's easier to catch PokÃ©mon when their health has been lowered by your attacks, or when they have a status ailment." Increase Catch Chance pt. 2"±Every time a PokÃ©mon breaks out of a ball, it'll be slightly easier to catch for the rest of the battle. You can check what your current catch chance is in the PokÃ© Ball menu."Finding Wild PokÃ©mon"UUse the DexNav to get information on which PokÃ©mon are available where you are."Trades"Throughout the world there will be people offering trades for PokÃ©mon. Usually they want a different PokÃ©mon, but sometimes they want money."What are Stats?"gStats, short for Statistics, are the numbers which determine how your PokÃ©mon performs in battle."Checking Stats"ŠCheck your PokÃ©mon's stats by looking at the second page of their summary screen, accessible through the PokÃ©mon menu in the pause menu."Stat Factors"˜Your PokÃ©mon's stats are calculated from a combination of their species' 'Base Stats', their own 'Style Points', and extra modifications during battle."Base Stats"­Every species of PokÃ©mon have base stats, which affect every PokÃ©mon of that species. e.g. Every Raichu will be fast because the Raichu species has a high Speed base stat."Style Points"”Style Points are numbers which you can customize to change your PokÃ©mon's stats. Style Points show as blue numbers on the stat page of the summary."Leveling and Evolution"…Your PokÃ©mon's stats will increase every time they level up. When PokÃ©mon evolve, their stats change (almost always they increase)."Accuracy and Evasion"Accuracy and Evasion are two stats which are only active in battle, starting at 100% each. They are only modified by in-battle changing effects."Stat Steps"“Effects can modify a PokÃ©mon's stats during battle. These are called 'stat steps'. Stat steps multiply or divide the PokÃ©mon's listed stat value."Bounds of Stat Steps"–Stat steps start at 0, and can increase up to +12 (4x) and down to -12 (.25x). Stat steps are usually reset if you swap the PokÃ©mon out or it faints."Checking Stat Steps"œYou can check the current stat steps of each PokÃ©mon on the battlefield using the Info button. It lists the numerical step as well as resultant multiplier."What are abilities?"ªAbilities are special powers that PokÃ©mon can have based on their species. Most PokÃ©mon can have 2 possible abilities. All abilities activate in battle or in the field."Ability Effects"rAbilities do a wide variety of different things. Understanding your team's abilities is important to winning."Checking Abilities"Check your PokÃ©mon's summary to see what main ability they have. Use the MasterDex to read about the abilities of enemy PokÃ©mon during battle."Choosing Abilities"A PokÃ©mon's default main ability is one of the two its species can have, randomly chosen when you get it. You can use Ability Capsules to swap to the other."Conditional Abilities"ƒMany abilities only do things under certain circumstances. Building around Weather and Room-synergy abilities is a common strategy."Effect Of Evolution"{A PokÃ©mon's ability tends to stay the same when evolving, but can change. When this happens, the game will alert you."Defeating Abilities"ƒAn enemy Trainer's ability too much? Abilities like Neutralizing Gas, and moves like Gastro Acid, can suppress abilities in battle."Swapping Abilities"Moves like Skill Swap can be used to give a new ability to PokÃ©mon during battle, enabling unique and creative team synergies."What are Held Items?"Held items are items which you can give your PokÃ©mon to benefit them during battle. They can increase their damage, heal them, or other things."Equipping an item"†You can give a PokÃ©mon an item from your bag, or through the summary screen. Not all items do an effect when held, so read carefully."Berries"†Berries are a common held item. During battles, PokÃ©mon will eat the berry to get a benefit. Get berries by picking from Berry Trees."Sitrus and Amwi Berry"£Sitrus Berry and Cado Berry are common berries which heal your PokÃ©mon when at low health. If in doubt about what item to give a PokÃ©mon, give them one of these."Rematerializer"~In PokÃ©mon Tectonic, the Rematerializer regenerates held items which are consumed in battle. You'll never run out of berries!"Wild Held Items"hWild PokÃ©mon can be found holding items. These items sometimes have held effects, but often don't."Getting More"You will find more held items on the ground when traveling, or as gifts from people, or as the reward for defeating Avatars, or as purchasable items in shops." What are Status Conditions?"‰Status Conditions are ailments a PokÃ©mon can have which hurt or restrict them. They remain after swapping out, and even between battles."Healing Status Conditions"xStatus Conditions are removed when you heal at the PokÃ©Center, after a trainer battle or when you use the Aid Kit."Status Immunity"‡Type immunities do not prevent status moves. However, some types give immunities to certain status conditions. Don't confuse these two!"When burned, a PokÃ©mon's Attack is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Fire- and Ghost-types do the most burning. Fire is immune."Frostbite"–When frostbitten, a PokÃ©mon's Sp. Atk is reduced by 33%, and loses 1/8th HP every turn. Ice- and Flying-types do the most frostbiting. Ice is immune."™When poisoned, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/12th HP every turn. This doubles every 2 turns. Poison- and Grass-types do the most poisoning. Poison/Steel are immune."When numbed, a PokÃ©mon's Speed is halved, and it deals 25% less damage. Electric- and Fighting-types do the most numbing. Electric is immune."Waterlog"•When waterlogged, a PokÃ©mon's Speed is halved, and it takes 25% more attack damage. Water- and Dark-types do the most waterlogging. Water is immune."‡When dizzied, a PokÃ©mon takes 25% more attack damage, and its ability doesn't function. Psychic- and Fairy-types do the most dizzying."–When leeched, a PokÃ©mon loses 1/12th HP every turn, and its opponent(s) split that health. Bug- and Dark-types do the most leeching. Grass is immune."A rarer status that causes a PokÃ©mon to be unable to do anything for 2 turns. Psychic- and Grass-types put PokÃ©mon to sleep the most often." What are Volatile Statuses?"xVolatile Status Conditions are similar to Status Conditions, except they will go away if the PokÃ©mon switches out."	Jinx"¦When jinxed, a PokÃ©mon cannot Protect itself, and all attacks against it are guaranteed critical hits. Jinx wears off after 3 turns. Fairy-types do the most jinxing."Fractured"…When fractured, a PokÃ©mon deals 33% less damage with its moves. Fracture wears off after 3 turns. Rock-types do the most fracturing."
Curse"]When cursed, a PokÃ©mon loses 25% of its HP every turn. Ghost-types do the most cursing."Torment"¤When tormented, a PokÃ©mon cannot use the same move twice in a row. If something prevents it from moving for a turn, it can choose the same move the following turn."
Taunt"CWhen taunted, a PokÃ©mon is prevented from using status moves."Disable"DWhen disabled, a PokÃ©mon cannot use the move it last selected."Bar"VWhen barred, a PokÃ©mon cannot use moves that don't share a type with themselves."Trapping"When trapped, a PokÃ©mon cannot switch out of battle. Includes manually switching, being forced out, or using a move like U-Turn."Substitute"ŒA substitute blocks attacks and status effects. It has HP equal to the amount of HP it took to create it. Sound tag moves ignore substitute."Transformed"yA transformed PokÃ©mon becomes a copy of another. It gains their ability, moves, stats (except HP), and step boosts."Perish Song"vA PokÃ©mon affected by Perish Song will faint when the timer ends. Avatars will be damaged for half of an HP bar."Grounded"tA grounded PokÃ©mon loses their immunity to ground moves (from being Flying-type or having a Levitate ability)."What are Critical Hits?"nA critical hit deals 50% more damage than a regular hit. Certain moves are able to randomly critical hit.""How common are Critical Hits?"zFor moves that can random crit, the chance is 1/8. This chance can be raised by abilities, items, or special effects."Other Effects"Critical hits ignore stat steps (on the user or the target) that would lower their damage. They also ignore protective screens like Reflect and Light Screen."Preventing Criticals"}Certain abilities prevent critical hits against that PokÃ©mon. The Lucky Chant effect protects their side from critical hits."Guaranteed Criticals"•Some moves or abilities are not random, but guarantee a critical hit under certain conditions. Otherwise, these act the same as random critical hits."What are Tribes?"¨Every PokÃ©mon has 1-3 Tribes, decided by their species. Have 5 PokÃ©mon of a shared Tribe on your team, and your entire team will receive that Tribe's bonus in battle!"Tribal Bonus"›Tribal Bonuses are not identical: each Tribe provides a unique boon. With careful team composition, you can have 2 or even 3 Tribal Bonuses active at once!"Are they important?"”Tribes are not required in any way to complete the game. They are simply an alternative team-building challenge to play with, like Single Type runs."What are Enemy Trainers?"”Enemy Trainers are the PokÃ©mon Trainers you will battle throughout the game. Some block your path forwards (like Gym Leaders), others are optional."Detecting Trainers"”Trainers are people who have a companion PokÃ©mon next to them. If a person doesn't have that, they either aren't a Trainer, or are an inactive one."Avoiding Trainers"ŸTrainers will challenge you if they see you within 4 tiles of them. Avoid them by going out of that distance, sneaking around them, or waiting until they move."How to win?"©If you defeat a Trainer but have not 'perfected' the fight, it doesn't count as a win. Frequently using Switch is the key to winning, as switching also restores some HP."Perfecting Fights"›If you defeat a Trainer without any of your PokÃ©mon fainting, you've 'perfected' the fight. They will leave forever and drop experience candy as a reward."Enemy Teams"›Enemy Trainers have their own teams of PokÃ©mon with their own moves and held items. It's important to pay attention to these possibilities to win battles."Differences"The typical trainer has 3 PokÃ©mon, but Gym Leaders will have more. Trainers with more PokÃ©mon also have more move variety and more items on their PokÃ©mon."Pro Trainers"°Pro Trainers are special Trainers, noted by their grey hair and black clothes. Their teams are always 6 PokÃ©mon, all with items, and built around a Tribal Bonus. They're hard!"Trainer Behaviour"¤Individual Trainers will always react to the same in-battle circumstances the same way. You can learn how to beat or even perfect a Trainer through trial and error."What are Avatars?"ˆAvatars are powerful enemy PokÃ©mon with unique properties that you will fight and destroy during your adventure. They cannot be caught."Avatars are Healthy"{Avatars have at least two health bars, which means they have a lot of health. Much more than double the normal amount!"Multi-Move"}Avatars can move twice each turn. Their second move will happen after every battler has used their regular move for the turn."Two Statuses"{Avatars are large, and have room for up to two status conditions at a time.
